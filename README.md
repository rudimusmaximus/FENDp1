# Design Decisions and My Project 'point of view'  

As a learning exercise, this section describes my design decisions.

## Layout with Flexbox and One CSS
No content left behind across views AND no menu required lead me to think a Flexbox would be best.

A single CSS file will be used to also contain any dynamic CSS because there's not enough complexity to require multiple files.

## Fonts

## Tables
